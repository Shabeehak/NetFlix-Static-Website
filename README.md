# Netflix Static Website Clone

A responsive Netflix landing page clone built using HTML5 and CSS3 as part of my web design learning journey.
This project focuses on UI replication, layout structuring, and inspired by the official Netflix website.

This project was created to strengthen my frontend fundamentals by recreating a real-world product interface.
It is a static website (no backend or authentication) designed purely for educational and practice purposes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 – Semantic structure
- CSS3 – Styling, Flexbox, Media Queries
- GitHub Pages – Hosting

## Features

- Netflix-inspired UI design
- Accordion-style FAQ section (CSS-only interaction)
- Clean and readable code structure
- Hosted using GitHub Pages

## What I Learned

- Structuring complex layouts with semantic HTML
- Styling responsive layouts using Flexbox
- Using media queries for mobile-first design
- Creating interactive UI elements using CSS only
- Deploying static websites with GitHub Pages

## Learning Context

This project was built as part of my web design and frontend development learning journey.
Its main purpose is to practice UI cloning and responsive layouts, not to replicate Netflix’s backend functionality.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Netflix.

## Future Improvements
